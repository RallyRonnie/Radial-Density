Portfolio Item Tree
===================

## Overview

Another take on the Portfolio Items page in Rally. This time using a radial chart style visualisation.

This app will allow you to select a type, then an item in your scope with that type and then it will create a tree of the child artifacts.

The artefacts are arranged in rings to effectively show you the quantity of stories attached to it and then coloured by the density of the story points
